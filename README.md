# DomainJoinGUI
Quickly Add Computers to a Domain With a GUI.


# Purpose:
This tool was created to assist in field contractors renaming and joining multiple computers to the domain.
It is recommended that you use a temporary account that can only join computers to the domain, with no other administrative permissions as credentials are stored and displayed in plaintext.
You can pre-define your credentials in the creds.cfg file.
